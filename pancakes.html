    <p>What's the secret to making the perfect pancakes? Trust Delia Smith to show you and enjoy Pancake Day without any flops. Delia's method uses milk and water for really thin, lacy edges. With added melted butter for flavour, these thin British pancakes taste best with drizzled with lemon juice and sprinkled with crunchy, granulated sugar.</p>
    <p>Each pancake (without topping) provides 88kcal, 7.5g carbohydrates (of which 0.9g sugars), 5g fat (of which 2g saturates), 0.4g fibre and 0.2g salt.</p>
